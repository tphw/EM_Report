# **Elephant Money Flaw Report**
## **Summary:**
<p align="justify">
  This is a report about a flaw discovered in a unverified contract (0x6839e295a8f13864A2830fA0dCC0F52e71a82DbF) of the Elephant Money project of the Binance Smart Chain. This flaw has a critical impact on the Trunk token (0xdd325C38b12903B727D16961e61333f4871A70E0), as it depends on the price of Trunk to be exploited, the damage will increase as the price of Trunk increases. For example, on July 21, with Trunk's price at $1.59 per token, direct losses would have been $1,016,968 with Trunk falling from 1.59 to 1.01, a 36 percent. Basically, there is a function (sweep()) in the vulnerable contract with no access control that allows a bad actor to trigger a cascade of swaps, which through flash loans and price manipulation of some assets could seriously harm EM users. I provide POCs using foundry to demonstrate what Im talking about. BUT, It's not all bad news, I have also discovered how to solve it !!! Below a detailed explanation of how this exploit is possible and how to avoid it.
